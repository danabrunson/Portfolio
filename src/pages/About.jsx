              Hi! My name is Dana Brunson. I recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science from
              North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. I am now working to obtain my Masters in Human 
              Centered Computing from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and am expected to graduate May 2027. My goal is to become a web developer, specializing
              in UX design. I am currently open to working, specifically internships related to my goals!
